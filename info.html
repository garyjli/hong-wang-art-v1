                    “Standing on the bare ground, -my head bathed by the blithe air and uplifted into 
                    infinite space,- all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am 
                    nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am 
                    part or particle of God.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    -Ralph Waldo Emerson, <em>Nature</em> (1836)

                    I was born in China but I've lived in Marin County for almost 18 years. Becoming an 
                    artist has been one of my dreams since I was a child, when I first saw my father sketch 
                    a portrait of my mother on a blackboard with chalk. I found his sketch so beautiful and 
                    impressive that I wanted to try it myself, but I never had the chance to because of 
                    inadequate resources. That was, until two years ago during the pandemic, when I first 
                    attempted to sketch in chalk. For the next few months, I continued to practice sketching 
                    and later moved on to soft pastel and watercolor painting with the help of a few online 
                    courses. Currently, I enjoy painting figures, landscapes, and still life, using a variety 
                    of mediums such as chalk, pastel, and watercolor. Outside of art, I love to read, hike, 
                    and admire the incredible nostalgic scenery of Marin County that reminds me of where I 
                    grew up. I wish to continue expanding my interest in art and discover unique ways to 
                    express my love for beautiful sceneries.
